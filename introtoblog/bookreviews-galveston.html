    <h4> GALVESTON </h4>

    <p> An existential update to the classic murder novel. For me, the book possesses a certain inseparability from Pizzolatto’s later True Detective Season 1, which I take to be the best eight hours of writing to ever grace a TV screen (probably something more like 96 hours with all my rewatches); Galveston exists in the same sort of creative sphere as TD: both main characters fit a mold of the “disturbed late thirties nihilist with trauma finding outlets for his violence” and both plots serve as a background of crime and a depraved, lesser world that facilitates their moral ambiguities. Both Roy Cady of the novel and TD’s Rust Cohle are the Rick Deckard, Llewelyn Moss, Thomas Shelby, Logan, Rorschach type, and their stories suit the expressions of these angry, deteriorating, sorrowful and aging men reminiscing in the power of youth - a sentiment that I feel deeply connected to as a high-schooler. 

        The show is littered with references to the book which I always feel proud of noticing: the Longhorn, where Marty’s sins with Lisa clash with his marriage, takes its name from a bar in the book, where  - similarly - Roy’s past catches up to him in the doorway of reconciliation. The same is true of the little Lone Star beer men, and I think that what Beth’s lady pimp says about her running out on her uncle might be a reference to Rocky’s backstory, but that could be a reach. 
        
        The book doesn’t have the same chemistry as the show: every single actor in TD hits the mark absolutely perfectly - every cop, suspect, police chief, but especially McConaughey and Woody, which goes without any saying at all, Michelle Monaghan (who I recognized the other day as a no-name FBI analyst in the first Jason Bourne movie), Dadarrio, and Shea Whigham - who gives one of the best sermons a fictional preacher has ever delivered - all knock every single word, expression and scene out of the park. Even Maggie’s dad, and Carla (the working girl Rust buys pills from) do an absolutely and utterly phenomenal job with everything they’re given. The book, with four characters whose names are worth remembering: Roy, Rocky, Tiffany (who I had to google) and Stan, is in essence really more of a character study, a lot more introspective and philosophical, which is great if you wanted even more of Rust and less of the casework. Pizzolatto delves straight into the souls of his characters and the gullet of society that corrodes their edges with the steadfast hand and language of a lost-generation novelist. Roy Cady is a man who slipped through the fingers of America’s outstretched hands and he has given up clawing at the back of her knuckles, now resigned to fending for himself in the wilderness beneath her.
        
        My only complaint: Pizzolatto’s characters are too badass. Roy in Galveston is a shoot-first-ask-questions-later neo-western outlaw, and McConaughey as Rust - which, don’t get me wrong, is one of the most impactful performances of modern television - fights to keep his rom-com smolder away from the camera, and sometimes it lands a jab on his brow. Both are chain-smoking, whiskey-drinking, pistol-toting tough guys, and it’s clear from the intimacy of the digressive introspection that both characters have at least a small element of self-insert to them, making it a little hard to take Roy seriously sometimes with his waistband .38 and his wrist-mounted switchblade of Pizzolattian design. 
        
        Regardless, this is one of my favorite novels. The plot is incredible, the writing is both romantic and simple, and, at 258 pages, a thoroughly entertaining way to spend a few afternoons.
        
       
    <p> Opening line: “A doctor took pictures of my lungs. They were full of snow flurries.” 
        
        Favorite quotes: “Depending on the places we passed,  the night around us shaded from ink black to red and purple to a washed-out yellow that hung like gauze in the dark, like you could see the dark sitting under the light, and then it would be back to ink black, and the air would change smells from sea salt to pine pulp to ammonia and burning oil.”

        “I woke thinking about Mary-Anne. My mother had strawberry blond hair and a pretty, strong-bond face, a dramatic face, and when she didn’t wear makeup she’d have dark raccoon rings, her only real flaw, but one that made her face deeper, and her eyes rummaged over things, searching out trinkets.”
        
        “She folded her fingers on her purse and sighed. All this rolling world of kudzu and bony trees and black water seemed to mean something to her, the way it meant things to me, and she watched out the window with a surrendering gaze. For both of us the landscape had a gravity that tugged us backward in time, possessed us with people we used to be.”</p>
