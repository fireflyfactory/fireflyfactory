    <b>portrait of a divorcè </b>

    my father’s chest is white now
    
    the same white snow rests on a dying tree
    
    and weighs its branches to its sides
    
    in a reflection under golden columns
    
    eating cereal from a tupperware

    
    <b>untitled IX</b>
    
    i saw a prophet the other morning,
    
    a blind man on the street corner,
    
    his arms draped and lifted
    
    over his white eyes 
    
    like dirty sneakers.
    
    i asked him what he saw,
    
    and he said nothing.

    
    the poem ends here.

    
    <b>twenty five</b>

    
    there are
    
    behind me
    
    men walking
    
    for a million miles
    
    on the ceiling
    
    of grass the
    
    sun is a puddle
    
    my feet dip into
    
    i stand on the
    
    sky
    
    it’s quiet 
    
    here

<b>a fall poem in the fall </b>

    would be very easy to write. 

    stained glass by light,

    fleeting sun on warmed skin-
    

    but (what meets my pen is this):

    the sun has stopped
    
    bleeding & all that’s left 
    
    are the black pines underwater
    

    are the falling, fallen charring bodies
    
    of oak of spruce of birch & branch careening
    
    their leaves comets of embers  
    
    under a sunset shot-through
    


 <b> XV </b>

    
    in a meadow behind the church
    
    i ran to the swimming hole and back
    
    joined the congregation of stone-skippers
    
    and their purebred mutts
    
    oxymoronic and naive
    
    the leaves swayed to the breeze
    
    swam naked in the streams
    

<b>from dad</b>

    
    Hey buddy I stole two tacos for
    
    you. They're in the microwave. I
    
    also stole a cookie. It's not in the
    
    microwave. The tacos are not great.
    
    But they were stolen with love.


<b>To whom it may concern </b>


    There is a river 

    That I am a part of

    Of blood and black 
    
    Water in my chest

    Mingling with the chemicals

    That swallow the horizon 
    

    My head makes the noise

    Of crickets, the hum of 
    
    Eternity. The 

    Earth will eat me
    
    There is a poison under
    
    My veins that cries for air
    
    And drowns on my insides
    
    Burns holes in my belly button
    
    Burrows in obsidian voids

    
    I know it will
    
    Only hurt for 
    
    A minute. 
    
    The short way
    
    Home. White-hot
    
    Eternity unfurls its fingers
    
    And knows my name. 
    

<b>a love letter regarding oranges</b>


    one day, the world will run out of sapphic metaphors involving fruit.
    
    and when that day comes, i will be here, 
    
    waiting for you, with nothing left but rinds, peels,
    
    and teeth stained darkly with pulp.
    
    i’ll have tucked away every last slice of an orange behind my teeth
    
    to preserve our love neatly between my lips
    
    and when you part them sweetly
    
    you’ll find, gently stowed, a clementine- 
    
    found on a summer’s bench
    
    left behind by a pair of lovers
    
    on the way to hold one another
    
    waiting for the sunset.
